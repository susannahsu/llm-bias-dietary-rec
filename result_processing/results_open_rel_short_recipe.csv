   - Add the diced zucchini and cook for another 5 minutes until tender.

   - If using, sprinkle a little shredded cheese on top of each stuffed pepper.

5. **Bake:**

6. **Serve:**

2. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the corn, beans, roasted butternut squash, cherry tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and avocado (if using). 

3. **Make the Dressing**: In a small bowl or jar, whisk together the olive oil, apple cider vinegar or lime juice, minced garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper.

4. **Toss the Salad**: Pour the dressing over the salad ingredients and gently toss to combine, making sure everything is well-coated.

5. **Adjust Seasonings**: Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Tofu:**
   - Drain the tofu and press it using a tofu press or by placing it between two plates with a weight on top for about 15 minutes. This removes excess moisture.
   - Once pressed, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes. Toss the tofu cubes in 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and let marinate for about 10 minutes.
   - After marinating, sprinkle the tofu with cornstarch and toss to coat evenly. This will help in giving the tofu a crispy texture when cooked.

2. **Cook the Tofu:**
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
   - Add the tofu cubes in a single layer and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden and crispy.
   - Remove the cooked tofu from the pan and set aside.

3. **Stir-Fry the Vegetables:**
   - In the same skillet or wok, add the minced garlic and grated ginger and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
   - Add the sliced bell peppers, broccoli, snap peas, and carrots to the pan. Stir-fry for about 4-5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

4. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of water, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and honey/maple syrup (if using).

5. **Combine Tofu and Vegetables:**
   - Return the cooked tofu to the pan with the vegetables. Pour the soy-ginger sauce over the tofu and vegetables.
   - Stir to combine and cook for another 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through and well coated in the sauce.

6. **Serve:**
   - If desired, sprinkle with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.
   - Serve hot over cooked brown rice or quinoa for a more filling meal.
